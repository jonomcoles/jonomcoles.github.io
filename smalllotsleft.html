			<u>SUBMISSION TEXT:</u></br></br>
			<i>Blurry Boundaries</i> is a 12-unit, 2-story housing project that considers the
			meaning of closeness amidst LA’s (im)material landscapes. Architecturally,
			the project re-composes the disconnected parts of the standard LA block
			into a collective whole. This is done by layering density legislation (SB 1123
			& LAMC §12.22A.33) to subdivide one lot into four, each with a primary residence, a lockout jADU, and a for-sale detached ADU, for a total of 12 units.
			These parts are nestled together to form a continuous series of shared yet
			private outdoor spaces between buildings, blurring boundaries of ownership. The buildings are cut at varying angles by the subdivided property
			boundaries, making each one unique and individual while relating to one
			another and the surrounding neighborhood. This replicable formal strategy
			and unit mix allows the project to function both as a diverse, flexible, community and a collection of distinct parts.</br></br></br></br></br>
			What appears to be a loose arrangement is in fact carefully regulated.
			Each building is organized according to a repeated 4ft modular wood framing system consisting of prefabricated wall, floor, and roof panels that can
			fit in a long-bed pick-up truck; on-site framing is only required at end walls.
			Building arrangement follows a 5ft fire separation offset, creating defensible
			space. Fast and cheap crawl-space foundations utilize CMU-blocks to resist fire spread; there are no exposed eaves. The project is fully electrified
			and off-the-shelf.</br></br></br></br></br>
			Tectonically, the project balances the need for fire resilience with livability,
			providing closeness, privacy and abundance of light and air without sacrificing safety. The primary solution is the treatment of end walls with fire-rated
			polycarbonate. The material is multi-purpose: it is more flame-resistant
			than glass and does not count towards glazing opening percentages, allowing more natural light to enter the interiors than is otherwise allowed by
			code at this proximity, while blurring views for privacy and mitigating heat
			gain. This material treatment also visualizes the otherwise immaterial spatial property system intrinsic to the project’s arrangement. The rest of the
			envelope thus requires minimal fenestration and is clad with board-andbatten GFRC, a durable, resilient, low-budget and high-tolerance surface
			that further expresses the modular framing. The project is simple, cheap
			and easy, while maintaining LA’s character: a fast, loose, expanding sum of
			discrete parts. </br></br></br></br></br>
