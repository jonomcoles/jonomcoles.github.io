			<i>Office <sup>2</sup></i><br/>
			11x14"<br/>

			<u>EXHIBITION TEXT:</u><br/><br/><br/>
			<i>Office<sup>2</sup></i> depicts a makeshift architectural office on a vacant floor of a building in South San Francisco.
			These architectural renderings are made from a digital replica of the building, produced by Coles from observations within the referenced site. 
			Constructed in 2012, this office building is being used to plan its own demolition and subsequent replacement with a new(er) office building.<br/><br/><br/>
			In this rendered architectural office space, paperwork, computers and printers dominate the workplace as opposed to the expected models, 
			drawings and images, presenting architects as managerial professionals who not only structure space but the flow of information and liability. 
			Their offices are sites of administration, from which other offices proliferate. Rejecting the architectural and financial logic of speculation, 
			these images constitute architectural visualization turning back on itself to represent a real space at the end of its life, as opposed to a new, imaginary one.<br/><br/><br/>
			3.12 million ft<sup>2</sup> of office space is currently under construction in San Francisco, despite 32.7 million ft<sup>2</sup> of office vacancy in the city. 
			This amount of vacant space is roughly equivalent to the entirety of Downtown Pittsburgh (37.2m ft<sup>2</sup>)— a city for whom San Francisco’s tech renaissance remains the shining model of economic growth.<br/><br/><br/>
