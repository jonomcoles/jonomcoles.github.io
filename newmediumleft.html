			Affordable housing in California negotiates political, legislative, cultural and 
			economic forces–impacting every scale between the local and federal. These forces 
			combine to form a perplexing nebula of boxes to tick, simultaneously complicating 
			and enabling the production of much-needed housing. In the context of these sometimes 
			contradictory forces, solutions are found in the relationships between granular 
			documentation: legal agreements, iterative legislation, local housing elements, 
			ballot measures, and updates to the fire code. This project considers these 
			tensions and deploys a rigorous reading of mountains of documentation, finding 
			form from minutiae. 
			</br></br>
			Within the High-Resource context of Menlo Park, this project proposes 91 units of
			affordable housing within an underused downtown parking lot, presenting a model 
			for sensitively densifying suburban America. AB 835 – a CA state bill aimed at overturning the
			requirement for two means of egress in R3 occupancies – is taken as an organizational generator.
			Interior circulation is moved outside 
			the building, reducing footprint and cost while introducing multiple exposures 
			to each apartment. Parking is maintained while outdoor space revives business 
			frontages. Off-kilter windows subtly dodge each other, maintaining privacy while 
			keeping “eyes on the street.” Patios become entrances, exploding the wall
			section to create defensible spaces and nested boundaries of privacy. 
			</br></br>
			<i>Completed collaboratively with Sophie Schnietz, this project was the winner
			of the James R. Boyce Affordable Housing Competition and the 2023 UC Berkeley 
			Architecture Design Excellence Award.</p>
