			1.2.5 <i>COMING SOON</i>PUBLICATION: TRACE 2</br></br>
			<u>EXHIBITION TEXT:</u></br></br>
			American residential construction is devastatingly
			pinned at the opposing extremes of single family spec-homes and double-loaded 5-over-1s.
			These typologies are clear reflections of the nation’s values, being significantly derived
			from the overlap of stoic codes, relentless profiteering, and the logistics of
			bureaucracy. While American architects acknowledge the limits on spatial planning
			imposed by US systems of value and governance, we have not yet perceived
			the subjectivity between these systems as a medium for design. Through an interrogation of regulatory
			systems on spatial planning, <i>(Un)American Egress</i> identifies and exploits loopholes
			in US building code, permitting, and development processes to bring American
			housing closer to ubiquitous global housing models.</br></br>
			<i>This project was exhibited as part of the Branner, Stump and Beckerman 2024 Travel Fellows
			Exhibition that took place in Bauer Wurster Hall in February, 2024. The project
			was advised by Rudabeh Pakravan.</i></br></br>
			TYPOLOGY 1: EGRESS BALCONIES</br></br>
			New multifamily housing in the US has a complicated relationship with public space. 
			Difficult to commodify – but necessary to underwrite as “luxury” – shared spaces in 
			5-over-1s are typically atomized and marketed as “amenities”. Bike storage, 
			computer rooms, and coworking spaces often remain vacant, physically existing as 
			vestigial formalities from a pro-forma used to apply for tax credits and convince 
			a bank to loan money. This project uses loose code definitions of “egress balconies” 
			to integrate otherwise cordoned shared space into generous roofs and occupiable corridors. 
			These circulatory and environmental strategies directly reference the balconies, patios, 
			and accessible roofs of Rio de Janeiro’s superblocks and some of Berlin’s recent housing, 
			promoting living along the facade. Technically existing as legal formalities and thus 
			unable to be marketed, access to these spaces from each unit is required by code but 
			habitation is discouraged, leaving them available for obvious informal use.</br></br>
			TYPOLOGY 2: "FOUR" STORIES</br></br>
			Despite centuries of global use, single-stair multifamily buildings are not 
			allowed in the United States. Except, if the single stair serves four units or 
			less. Except, if those units are below three stories. Except, if that fourth 
			story is a mezzanine. This eight unit building exploits these hazy, ancient 
			overlaps in code requirements to stack two-story loft apartments around a 
			single stair. The stair runs to the third floor, serving as egress for the 
			upper units and, by extension, their “fourth floor” mezzanines. A mashup of 
			the Athenian Polikatoikias, a stepped-back terrace building, and the oddly 
			shaped Haussmannian typology with their attics often accessible by ladder, 
			it achieves their dynamic light, quirky interiors, and indoor-outdoor living, 
			all at a rentable floor-area efficiency of 95%.</br></br>
