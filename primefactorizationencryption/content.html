	This is a two-keyed encryption method that utilizes prime factorization to 
	heavily encode text strings. Here is how it works:</br></br>
	Given:</br></br> 
	</font></i>
	<font face="courier" size="2">
	0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</br>
	2132&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;764599</br>
	564231&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4878745901</br></br>
	<font face="times" size="2"><i>
	This method treats the entries in the first row as the key designations. The
	left entry represents the key shift designation. This dictates that the relationship
	between the "n"th letter of the alphabet corresponds to the "n+0"th prime number. 
	Similarly, the right entry is the key multiplier designation, and dictates
	that the "n"th letter of the alphabet corresponds to the "n*1"th prime number. In 
	the encryption software, the key multiplier designation acts first. Using the given 
	key designations, we have the following key:</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="courier" size="2">
	a = 2</br>
	b = 3</br>
	c = 5</br>
	...</br>
	x = 89</br>
	y = 97</br>
	z = 101</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="times" size="2"><i>
	Lets say the first row of the given code was instead as follows:</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="courier" size="2">
	5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="times" size="2"><i>
	Then we would have the following key:</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="courier" size="2">
	a = 19</br>
	b = 31</br>
	c = 43</br>
	...</br>
	x = 389</br>
	y = 409</br>
	z = 431</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="times" size="2"><i>
	Going back to the original example, the remaining two rows are solvable now that
	the key has been calculated. The left entries of the remaining rows are the
	order designations, while the right rows are the value designations. These numbers 
	dictate the value order of prime factors. The lengths of these designations are 
	measured to find the amount of prime factors for the value designation. For example 
	the first order designation is:</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="courier" size="2">
	2132</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="times" size="2"><i>
	This method interprets this as meaning that there are four factors of the value designation,
	and that the second largest comes first, the smallest comes second, the largest comes
	third, and the second largest comes last again. Using this information, one can analyze
	the value designation, which is the following:</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="courier" size="2">
	764599</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="times" size="2"><i>
	This method follows a simple if loop that runs once for each factor that must be found.
	Using the key, the largest possible prime number is divided from the value designation.
	If the result is not an integer, then the next largest prime number is tested. This 
	process is repeated until an integer value is produced. This integer is then negated
	from further calculation unless its corresponding value in the order designation is repeated.
	Repeating this step four times, once for each factor in our first row, one finds the following
	factors:</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="courier" size="2">
	11        11        71        89</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="times" size="2"><i>
	Arranging these factors according to the order designation yields the following:</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="courier" size="2">
	71        11        89        71</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="times" size="2"><i>
	Plugging in the corresponding letter values yields the following:</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="courier" size="2">
	"text"</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="times" size="2"><i>
	Repeating these steps for the third row yields the following:</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="courier" size="2">
	"string"</br></br>
	</font>
	<font face="times" size="2"><i>
	This method combines two somewhat uncommon cryptography methods to create an interesting
	encryption code. Using very large key designations could result in messages that would
	be very difficult to decrypt without software.</br></br>
