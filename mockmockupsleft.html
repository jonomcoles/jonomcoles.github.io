			1.2.6 <i>COMING SOON </i>PUBLICATION: PLAT 14<br/><br/><br/><br/>
			Prior to comprising a building, construction materials are described in various 
			spreadsheets that serve to distribute legal risk and predict exchange value in 
			the real-estate market. I’m referring to the specification-submittal process, 
			where an architect specifies the qualities of a material to a contractor, who 
			then selects the exact material product, furnishes a sample, and submits it 
			back to the architect for approval of its “aesthetic effect”. This contractual, 
			bureaucratic guessing game is designed to push liability for material selection 
			onto the contractor. Furthermore, the architect’s client includes these material 
			specifications in a bank appraisal to secure project funding; in this case, the 
			dollar-difference between the appraisal and the contractor’s cost estimate, both 
			gleaned from the specifications, dictates whether the project will be realized.<br/><br/><br/>
			The material sample acts as a medium of value in this nebulous overlap of legal 
			and financial structures, serving as an interface between function, risk, economy, 
			and aesthetics. <i>Mock Mock-ups</i> is an ongoing series of material samples that 
			interrogates this interface by tinkering with discrepant methods of value attribution: 
			bank appraisals and cost estimates. Each sample takes a common specification – 
			brick veneer, hardwood floor, bathroom tile, etc. – and slightly alters its assembly 
			to produce an informal aesthetic with an undefined exchange value. Originally 
			specified, estimated, and appraised for a residential project in Pittsburgh, PA, 
			the paired documents show subjective discrepancies between unit prices and influence 
			on speculated property value. The samples utilize Magnesium-Oxide mortars, a messy, 
			breathable alternative binder that absorbs atmospheric carbon when curing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
			<i>Various contents of Mock Mock-ups have been exhibited in numerous settings, 
			most recently in Material Acts, an exhibition at Craft Contemporary curated by 
			Jia Yi Gu and Kate Yeh Chiu as part of Getty PST 2024 in LA.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
