					Completed in 1908, Frank Lloyd Wright's Unity Temple is one of the 
					first non-industrial structures to feature rebar-reinforced concrete.
					In 2015 the Unity Temple Restoration Foundation ordered $25 million in 
					repairs to remediate extensive cracking and surface deterioration.</br></br>
					
					In 2011 my 8th grade geometry teacher David Ross instructed his 
					students to solve "brain teaser" puzzles during class. All of Ross' 
					puzzles were constructed from two interlocked and identical twisted
					concrete nails. The puzzles were considered to be solved when the nails
					were separated.</br></br>
					
					This sculpture attempts to recreate the mangled figure of demolished 
					rebar within the context of the deterioration of the Unity Temple by
					mimicking the form of David Ross' puzzles.
