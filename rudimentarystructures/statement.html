					This project is an engineered emulation of Humanity's earliest efforts to influence the
					built environment. The first human-made structures were typically fabricated in one common form: 
					the pillar. These rudimentary structures were used for prayer, astronomy, and cartography. This same form
					has manifested itself prominently in the modern built environment. This project attempts to re-construct
					the pillar on a much smaller scale to infer the intrinsically iterative design process used to create the built environment,
					while simultaneously illustrating humanity's connection to and derivation from the natural environment. </br></br>
					
					3 rectangular prisms were created for this project. Their dimensions follow the Fibonacci series, 
					a mathematical phenomenon enacted by combining the values of the two previous iterations to find the next. This
					relationship mirrors the human familial action of two parents creating a child.
					Numbers in this series can be found consistently throughout the natural environment, such as in 
					the petals of a flower or the pattern of seeds in a pinecone. This emphasizes the inherent presence
					of iterative processes in nature.</br></br>
					
					The structures in this project were created using only wood ash and rain water. Wood ash can be sieved and
					treated so that it functions as a cement paste when combined with water. The wood ash cement used for this
					project was tested according to the cement standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials,
					and registered a strength of 3062.691psi. This measurement is slightly higher than that of standard Type 1 concrete.
