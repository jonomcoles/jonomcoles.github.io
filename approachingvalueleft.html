			<u>EXHIBITION TEXT:</u><br/><br/><br/>
			<i>Approaching Value</i> confronts a fundamental discrepancy in architectural practice; the profession is valued 		
			in theory as a fine art while operating in practice as a bureaucratic, managerial 
			service. This discrepancy has mislocated the domain and value of architectural labor, obfuscating 
			practiceâ€™s true staging between bureaucratic regimes of finance and governance. Suffocated 
			and paralyzed, can new models of practice confront this staging to explore alternative 
			systems of value, and propose other ways of living?<br/><br/><br/>
			The project presents the office of a young architecture practice through the documentation of its first
			project, a flexible co-housing building in Pittsburgh, PA. Each document in the office confronts an
			approach to value: a method for determining the value of architecture. Appraisals, estimates, applications,
			etc. are strewn across the workplace. Upon closer inspection, each defines value through different
			criteria, varying in subjectivity from the simple multiplication of factors from real estate websites, to
			rigorous schedules for each set of building components and the labor required to install them. Amidst
			this disarray, the work of the office has become the exploitation of these subjectivities; each format is
			manipulated slightly to the advantage of the architect(ure).<br/><br/><br/>
			This new practice is defined by exploring the discrepancies between these approaches to value: the
			building is permitted and financed as two single-family homes, legalized as six condominiums, and
			inhabited as up to twelve studios. Its setbacks and spatial planning exploit the poor overlaps between
			the IRC and local building codes. Its assemblies are slightly sagged, drooped, and underdone, retaining
			their evaluatory definitions while becoming almost unrecognizable. Sloppy brick, exaggerated
			parquet floor, and fractured tile appear conventional on paper, while resolving in practice as slightly
			unfamiliar and sincerely deceptive, teetering between standardness and nonconformity. This project narrates a
			practice that puts forth new models of living by hacking systems of value.<br/><br/><br/>
			<i>This project was completed as an M.Arch Thesis at UC Berkeley under Neyran Turan and Andrew Atwood,
			and was exhibited in Bauer Wurster Hall in May of 2024.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
